# Habit Tracker

> Note : Is in development

Track your habits by marking the calendar each day. This technique was put forward by Jerry Seinfeld, and has been called his 'productivity secret'.

If you don't always have a physical calendar handy, or don't want to write on it, this will work out great for you.
